In this project we plan to create a simple interface that uses a guitar shaped controller (like the ones used in Guitar Hero or Rock Band) to produce sounds using a MIDI synthesizer. The interface will allow the player to map (and customize) key or set of keys to a musical note or chord, accordingly. This way we will enable, for instance, the user to play musics that use up to 31 (5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1) unique chords or notes, using a 5 key controller. The interface should also allow the definition of key pre-sets as well as a dedicated switch-key on the guitar to navigate between pre-sets, therefore increasing the total number of unique notes and chords. We would also like to include, if time and schedule permits, support for the whammy bar through a range of fully customizable effects and plugin API.
